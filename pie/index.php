Pan Island Expressway Berhad (PIEB) was established on March 13, 2013 to construct and operate the Pan Island
Expressway (PIE) on Pulau Tiong. The PIE is a 25km open-toll expressway that will never traverse from north to south
along the eastern coast of the island and forms part of the Pulau Tiong Road (PTRR). The expressway will
also feature a 5km tunnel that will run underneath the central business district of Myna Town.
